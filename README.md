## 1. Problem Statement
   Hi Digital Accelerator,
      May I introduce myself? I'm Claire, Call Centre Manager here at PhoneNow. My colleague suggested I reach out to you. Pleased to meet
      you.
      I'm looking for transparency and insight into the data we have here at the Call Centre. For example: total number of calls answered and
      abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. What I'm after is an accurate overview of long-term
      trends in customer and agent behaviour.
      I was told you are great at visualising data in such a way that important aspects become very clear. Thats precisely what I need.
      Could you please prepare a dashboard on Call Centre trends that I can use as a basis for discussion with management? I'll provide you
      with the required data, of course.
      Looking forward to hearing from you.
    Best regards,
    Claire
