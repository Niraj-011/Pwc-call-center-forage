## 1. Problem Statement:


   Hi Digital Accelerator,
      May I introduce myself? I'm Claire, Call Centre Manager here at PhoneNow. My colleague suggested I reach out to you. Pleased to meet
      you.
      I'm looking for transparency and insight into the data we have here at the Call Centre. For example: total number of calls answered and
      abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. What I'm after is an accurate overview of long-term
      trends in customer and agent behaviour.
      I was told you are great at visualising data in such a way that important aspects become very clear. Thats precisely what I need.
      Could you please prepare a dashboard on Call Centre trends that I can use as a basis for discussion with management? I'll provide you
      with the required data, of course.
      Looking forward to hearing from you.
    Best regards,
    Claire

## 🎯 Task 1:
      Create a dashboard in Power Bl for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators
      (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative!
      Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
      1. Overall customer satisfaction
      2. Overall calls answered/abandoned
      3. Calls by time
      4. Average speed of answer
      5. Agent's performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
